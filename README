# Build your lisp

I want to do some work to creat my programming language.
I heard about Lisp already.Really happy to study it.
To do this project,I hope I can learn not only C and Lisp but also
computer tools such as vim,git,markdown,linux commands ...

About the git branchs:
	before chapter-04: v0.00,v0.01
	include and after chapter-04: start at v0.04 and the appended number will plus 1  after you finishing one chapter.
	That means there will be no v0.02,v0.03.v0 will be used util I finished the project.v1 will start if I want to improve it next time.

Just try to do, never give up.
